yawp (0.4.1)
  * Add ability to open forecast in browser (if URL is provided by ION)
  * ION wunderground is returning a sorted list of cities (airport stations are listed on top of list,
    because in general terms this station type contains more weather information than the personal weather station type).
  * ION Wunderground is supporting satellite maps as well
  * ION accuweather is not using a config-file for satellite image mapping any longer (feature has been added in version 0.4.0
    but I think this was a stupid idea). Satellite images will be hard coded mapped to location in ION.
  * Translations updated (CZ, FR) 
  * Several little bug fixes - including geometry issues

yawp (0.4.0)

  * Bugfix: text in animation area jumps up or down at start and at the end of animation
  * applets painting methods has been extracted and rewritten, for re-use and hopefully the new painting methods are well structured
  * yaWP supports externder items (in panel mode only) - extender item interacts with user like desktop mode.
    In panel mode:
        When user clicks on the applet (but not on the weather forecast icons) the extender pops up.
        The behavior of the applet for clicking on the weather forecast icons can be configured in the config dialog on page "Panel"
        option "Use interactive weather icons". When this option is checked the weather icon will toggle between day and night
        (in case we have weather information for day and night) otherwise the extender will appear.
  * Removes old files from cache directory $HOME/.cache/yawp on a regular base.
  * The install script install.sh uses more CPU cores if available. Could be override by -j script option.
  * Turkish translation (thanks to Hasan Kiran)
  * Czech, Slovak and French translation updated
  * Changing unit system in config dialog will force auto-update.
  * AccuWeather will use a config file for satellite mapping.
